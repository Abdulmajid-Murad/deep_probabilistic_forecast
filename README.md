# Deep Probabilistic Forecast
PyTorch implementation of deep probabilistic forecast applied to air quality.


## Introduction

In this repo, we build deep probabilistic models that forecast air quality values and predict threshold exceedance events.


## Installation

install 'probabilistic_forecast' locally  in “editable” mode ( any changes to the original package would reflect directly in your environment, os you don't have to re-insall the package every time you make some changes): 

 ```bash
 pip install -e .
 ```
